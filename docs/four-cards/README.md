## Overview
We were challenged to use CSS Grid and or Flexbox to create this design. Overall the designt terrible but getting the grid to stay the same and move around on the different screen sizes was a bit of a challenge. I found that the tablet was actually the hardest to create. The desktop and mobile were quite easy.
