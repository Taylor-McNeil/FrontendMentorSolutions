## Reflections
I found this challenge to really fun. It took a minute to figure out how to get the transitions to work properly. I gave myself a lot of work trying to figure how to invert the icons to also match the transitions but it was fun to figure out. In hindsight, I don't know if I actually like the icons on the design, perhaps it was better without them. But I learned a lot from adding them in there.
